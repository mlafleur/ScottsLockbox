Scott's Lockbox
===============

My 8 year old son Scott came home from 2nd grade very excited about his school's Science Fair. He had decided he wanted to build something and he and I set out to find a project. When we stumbled upon Adafruit's Biometric Lock Box (https://learn.adafruit.com/biometric-security-box/overview) he was sold. And since I obviously have no grasp over what is approiate for 2nd grade, I completely agreed. 

We augmented thier project somewhat, skipping the biometic compoents for a simpler keypad only model. We also decided to use one of our Netduino's rather than the Arduino so he could use C#. 

This repo contains the Netduino code required for the project.
